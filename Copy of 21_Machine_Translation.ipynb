This tutorial will extend that idea to do Machine Translation of human languages by combining two RNN's.\n","\n","You should be familiar with TensorFlow, Keras and the basics of Natural Language Processing, see Tutorials #01, #03-C and #20."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"94pYACi2dcNd"},"source":["## Flowchart\n","\n","The following flowchart shows roughly how the neural network is constructed. It is split into two parts: An encoder which maps the source-text to a \"thought vector\" that summarizes the text's contents, which is then input to the second part of the neural network that decodes the \"thought vector\" to the destination-text.\n","\n","The neural network cannot work directly on text so first we need to convert each word to an integer-token using a tokenizer. But the neural network cannot work on integers either, so we use a so-called Embedding Layer to convert each integer-token to a vector of floating-point values. The embedding is trained alongside the rest of the neural network to map words with similar semantic meaning to similar vectors of floating-point values.\n","\n","For example, consider the Danish text \"der var engang\" which is the beginning of any fairytale and literally means \"there was once\" but is commonly translated into English as \"once upon a time\". We first convert the entire data-set to integer-tokens so the text \"der var engang\" becomes [12, 54, 1097]. Each of these integer-tokens is then mapped to an embedding-vector with e.g. 128 elements, so the integer-token 12 could for example become [0.12, -0.56, ..., 1.19] and the integer-token 54 could for example become [0.39, 0.09, ..., -0.12]. These embedding-vectors can then be input to the Recurrent Neural Network, which has 3 GRU-layers. See Tutorial #20 for a more detailed explanation.\n","\n","The last GRU-layer outputs a single vector - the \"thought vector\" that summarizes the contents of the source-text - which is then used as the initial state of the GRU-units in the decoder-part.\n","\n","The destination-text \"once upon a time\" is padded with special markers \"ssss\" and \"eeee\" to indicate its beginning and end, so the sequence of integer-tokens becomes [2, 337, 640, 9, 79, 3]. During training, the decoder will be given this entire sequence as input and  the desired output sequence is [337, 640, 9, 79, 3] which is the same sequence but time-shifted one step. We are trying to teach the decoder to map the \"thought vector\" and the start-token \"ssss\" (integer 2) to the next word \"once\" (integer 337), and then map the word \"once\" to the word \"upon\" (integer 640), and so forth.\n","\n","This flow-chart depicts the main idea but does not show all the necessary details e.g. regarding the loss function which is also somewhat complicated."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nmyCYyYBdcNt"},"source":["![Flowchart](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/images/21_machine_translation_flowchart.png?raw=1)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OnwttXRadcN2"},"source":["## Imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"JXNCCTEGdcN3"},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import numpy as np\n","import math\n","import os"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r-GbFULldcOY"},"source":["We need to import several things from Keras."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"zGCU0DRtdcOt"},"outputs":[],"source":["# from tf.keras.models import Model  # This does not work!\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Model\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense, GRU, Embedding\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop\n","from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, TensorBoard\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer\n","from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xH7jnHxjdcOv"},"source":["This was developed using Python 3.6 (Anaconda) and package versions:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"id":"Q2tNpiVXdcOx"},"outputs":[],"source":["tf.__version__"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"vmFu7sZEdcO2"},"outputs":[],"source":["tf.keras.__version__"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Op6BzsH9dcO6"},"source":["## Load Data\n","\n","We will use the Europarl data-set which has sentence-pairs in most European languages.

The research literature often uses an LSTM instead of the GRU, so they used the encoder's **state** instead of its output as the initial state of the decoder. Can you rewrite this code to use the encoder's state as the decoder's initial state? Is there a reason to do this, or is the encoder's output sufficient to use as the decoder's initial state?\n","* Is it possible to connect multiple encoders and decoders in a single neural network, so that you can train it on different languages and allow for direct translation e.g. from Danish to Polish, German and French?\n","* Explain to a friend how the program works."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XTKGiQpBdcWm"},"source":["## License (MIT)\n","\n","Copyright (c) 2018 by [Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen](http://www.hvass-labs.org/)\n","\n","Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n","\n","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n","\n","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
